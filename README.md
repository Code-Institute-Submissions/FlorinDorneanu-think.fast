Think Fast is a general questions quiz game. The quiz has ten questions that the user has to answer in 60 seconds. If the time is over, the game finishes. The user has to press Start button to enter the questions. After one question is answered, the user has to press the submit button to get to the next question. When all the questions are answered and the user presses the Submit button, the results will be shown to the user. The user can reload the quiz or quit it. The user is presented with the rules of the quiz in the beginning of the game, when pressing the button Game Rules.

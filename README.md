# Think Fast
## Milestone Project Two

Think Fast is a general questions quiz game. The quiz has ten questions that the user has to answer in 60 seconds. If the time is over, the game finishes. The user has to press Start button to enter the questions. After one question is answered, the user has to press the submit button to get to the next question. When all the questions are answered and the user presses the Submit button, the results will be shown to the user. The user can reload the quiz or quit it. The user is presented with the rules of the quiz in the beginning of the game, when pressing the button Game Rules.
The quiz has simple and diverse questions so is suitable for all users ages.

## Surface

### Colour
A shade of red and a shade of yellow were used primarily on the website. The colours were chosen for their playful vibe and the nice contrast. Black and white, being strong in contrast colours, were used for typography because they work great with the primary colours.

### Typography
The chosen fonts are "Rajdhan" and "Teko". The "Teko" font was used for the heading and the "Rajdhan" was used for the answers. The fonts have been taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Call to Action
* The "Start" button takes the user to the questions of the quiz game.
* The "Game Rules" button opens the rules of the game. From there the user can click on the button "Start" that takes the user to the questions of the quiz.
* The "Submit" button takes the user to the next question.
* At the end of the questions, when the user presses on the "Submit" button, the user will be presented with the score achieved.
* At the end of the game, the user can choose to press the "Reload" button for another play of the quiz.

### Features to Implement in future
* A highscore board;
* A list of 100 questions from where only 10 questions will be randomly selected.
* To use random storage for registering the question game and highscore.
* The incorrect and correct answer to have different colours.
